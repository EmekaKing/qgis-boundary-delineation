qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Supports interactive delineation of visible (cadastral) boundaries in orthoimages
version=0.1
author=Sophie Crommelinck
email=s.crommelinck@utwente.nl

about=The plugin is designed to support the interactive delineation of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data. The plugin is part of a delineation tool, in which the output from gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels are combined based on random forest classification. The subsequent interactive delineation is managed with the BoundaryDelineation plugin. Scripts and info on the other workflow parts can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/SCrommelinck/Delineation-Tool).
