# BoundaryDelineation
This is the repository for the QGIS Plugin Boundary Delineation. Provided here are the source code (folder: BoundaryDelineation), as well as test data (folder:  BoundaryDelineation/test). A manual as well as a YouTube video on its use can be found on the project website (https://its4land.com/automate-it-wp5/).

The Plugin is designed to support the semi-automatic delineation of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data. For visualization and digitization purposes, an orthoimage captured with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is required. Further, a vectorized output of gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels are required. The plugin combines the two vectorized datasets to network and nodes aiming to support the digitalization of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data.

This research is part of its4land (https://its4land.com/), a European Commission Horizon 2020 project that aims to deliver an innovative suite of land tenure recording tools. These tools are intended to respond to sub Saharan Africa’s immense challenge to rapidly and cost-effectively map millions of unrecognized or unrecorded land rights, in order to register them in formal land administration systems. An overview of the project was presented at the World Bank Conference on Land and Poverty (https://www.conftool.com/landandpoverty2017/index.php/11-07-Bennett-288_paper.pdf?page=downloadPaper&filename=11-07-Bennett-288_paper.pdf&form_id=288&form_version=final).

The work package (WP 5 – Automate It) that this Plugin is developed for is part of its4land. It aims to exploit the use of high-resolution UAV imagery combined with an image interpretation workflow that automatically extracts relevant land tenure features from UAV data. These can be physical objects such as hedges, fences, stone walls, tree lines, roads, walkways or waterways that often demarcate cadastral boundaries. Such an approach cannot deliver complete matching – as some tenure boundaries are only social and not visible to sensors – however, even 50% matching would radically alter tenure mapping workflow costs and times. The scientific progress of finding optimal methods and combining them in a workflow is ongoing. A review on related issues and case studies, such as the combination of cadastral mapping and remote sensing as well as image-based feature extraction methods has been published (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/8/689). The initial workflow step – gPb contour detection – was explained, evaluated and published (http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/2/171). The second workflow step – SLIC superpixels – is submitted and accepted, but not yet published.
