about=The Plugin is designed to support the semi-automatic delineation of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data. For visualization and digitization purposes, an orthoimage captured with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is required. Further, a vectorized output of gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels are required. The plugin combines the two vectorized datasets to network and nodes aiming to support the digitalization of visible cadastral boundaries from UAV data.
